    <img src="onion rings.jpg" alt="Onion Rings">
    <p>Onion rings are a popular fried snack or side dish made from sliced onion rings that have been coated in a batter or breading mixture and then deep-fried until they are crispy and golden brown. The result is a crunchy and flavorful outer layer with a tender, slightly sweet onion inside.</p>
<h2>List of Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Large onions</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Cornstarch or baking powder (for added crispiness)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Optional seasonings (such as paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, etc.)</li>
    <li>Milk or buttermilk (for the batter)</li>
    <li>Oil for frying (vegetable oil or another frying oil of your choice)</li>
    <p>Keep in mind that specific recipes might vary slightly, and you can also find variations that use different types of flours, coatings, and seasonings to create unique flavors. Additionally, you'll likely need some basic kitchen equipment like a mixing bowl, tongs, and a deep-frying pot or pan. Don't forget dipping sauces to serve alongside your onion rings!</p>
</ul>
<h2>The cooking process</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Peel the onions and slice them into 1/2-inch rings. Separate the rings and set them aside.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch or baking powder, salt, black pepper, and any optional seasonings you're using. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices.</li>
<li>Pour the milk or buttermilk into a separate bowl.</li>
<li>Dip the onion rings into the dry flour mixture, shaking off any excess.</li>
<li>Dip the floured onion rings into the milk/buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off.</li>
<li>Place the milk-coated onion rings back into the dry flour mixture.</li>
<li>Coat the rings thoroughly with the flour mixture, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
<li>In a deep-frying pot or pan, heat the oil to around 350-375°F (175-190°C). You can test the oil's readiness by dropping a small piece of batter into the oil, it should sizzle and float to the top.</li>
<li>Carefully place a few coated onion rings into the hot oil, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Fry for about 2-3 minutes, or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Flip the rings occasionally for even frying.</li>
<li>Use tongs to remove the fried onion rings from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
<li>Fry the remaining onion rings in batches, following the same process.</li>
<li>Serve the hot and crispy onion rings immediately with your favorite dipping sauces, such as ketchup, mayonnaise, ranch dressing, or barbecue sauce.</li>
