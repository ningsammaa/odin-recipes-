<h2>The cooking process:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pre-heat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe (usually around 350°F or 175°C).</li>
<li>Measure out all the ingredients and have them ready for use.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
<li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
<li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips (or chunks) and chopped nuts, if using.</li>
<li>Use a cookie scoop or spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave enough space between each cookie for them to spread while baking.</li>
<li>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for the time specified in the recipe, usually around 8-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set.</li>
<li>Once baked, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
<li>Once the cookies have cooled, they are ready to be enjoyed! Serve them with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.</li>
