    <p>Cinnamon rolls are a type of sweet baked pastry made from a dough that is rolled out, spread with a mixture of cinnamon, sugar, and butter, and then rolled into a log shape. The log is then sliced into individual rolls, which are placed in a baking dish and baked until they are golden brown and fully cooked.</p>

<h2>The process of preparing the delighful cinnmon rolls.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan, heat the milk until it's warm but not boiling. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of flour, yeast, sugar, butter, eggs, and salt.</li>
<li>Add the warm milk to the mixture and mix until well combined.
    Gradually add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together.</li>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the softened butter over the dough's surface.</li>
<li>In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar and ground cinnamon for the filling.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the buttered dough.</li>
<li>Starting from one long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log.</li>
<li>Using a sharp knife or dental floss, cut the log into slices, about 1 to 1.5 inches thick.</li>
<li>Place the cinnamon roll slices into a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll.</li>
<li>Cover the baking dish with a clean kitchen towel and let the rolls rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until they have doubled in size.</li>
<Li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and fully cooked.</Li>
<li>In a bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk or cream, and vanilla extract (if using) until smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>Drizzle the glaze over the warm cinnamon rolls.</li>
<li>Allow the cinnamon rolls to cool slightly before serving.</li>
