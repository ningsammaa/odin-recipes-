<h2>The process of preparing the mouth-watering hot chocolate.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar. This will help prevent lumps when adding it to the liquid.</li>
<li>Add about 2 tablespoons of hot water to the cocoa-sugar mixture. Stir well until you have a smooth paste. This step helps to dissolve the cocoa powder and create a uniform mixture.</li>
<li>In a saucepan, pour 1 cup of milk. You can use whole milk, 2% milk, or any milk of your preference.</li>
<li>Heat the milk over medium heat until it's warm but not boiling. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking or burning.</li>
<li>Once the milk is warm, gradually add the cocoa paste to the milk while stirring continuously. This ensures that the cocoa paste is well incorporated into the milk.</li>
<li>Continue to stir the mixture gently as it simmers over low to medium heat. This will help the cocoa mixture dissolve completely into the milk and infuse the flavors.</li>
<li>If desired, add 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mixture. Vanilla enhances the overall flavor of the hot chocolate.</li>
<li>Add a pinch of salt to enhance the chocolate flavor and balance the sweetness. Stir well to combine.</li>
<li>Taste the hot chocolate and adjust the sweetness level by adding more sugar if needed. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved.</li>
<li>Once the hot chocolate is heated through and well mixed, remove the saucepan from the heat.</li>
<li>Pour the hot chocolate into mugs or cups for serving.</li>
<Li>If desired, top the hot chocolate with whipped cream, marshmallows, or chocolate shavings. These add an extra layer of flavor and visual appeal.
</Li>
<li>Serve the hot chocolate immediately while it's still warm and comforting.</li>
<p>Sip and enjoy the rich, chocolatey goodness of your homemade hot chocolate!</p>
